Install instructions for bRopo (BALTRAD ROPO)

INTRODUCTION
bRopo is the FMI processing software ROPO that has been adapted
to coexist with the RAVE processing framework (BALTRAD toolbox).

REQUIREMENTS

Before installing bRopo a number of modules/software packages have to be
installed (along with their dependencies). But in short, if you have the
following packages installed you should be good to go.
- a (Gnu) C++ compiler
- GNU make
- Python 2.6 final or 2.7.x, but not 3.x
- RAVE (at least build hudson-Rave-172-SUCCESS)
- libpng12.so PNG image files

PREPARATION
RAVE has it's own installation instructions so follow them in order to get the
RAVE package in place.

PNG12 can usually be installed as a package, in some Debian-based Linuces it 
can be installed with
%> sudo apt-get install libpng12-0
Otherwise, try your RPM manager, e.g. yum or yumex.

BUILDING
The building is performed with the traditional ./configure; make; make install.

The simplest way to configure bRopo is to ensure that you have access to RAVE
through Python and then let ./configure attempt to identify the RAVE software.
If the following succeeds, then you should have no problem.
%> python -c "import _rave;print _rave.__file__"
/opt/baltrad/rave/Lib/_rave.so

If not, you probably need to use the configure arguments for RAVE together with
PNG, as follows.

CONFIGURE ARGUMENTS
--prefix=ROOT                 This is the root directory of the bropo 
                              installation. [default /opt/baltrad/bropo]

--with-rave=ROOT              Points out the RAVE root directory (default 'yes')
  
--with-png=ROOT or INC,LIB    Points out the PNG root installation or include, 
                              library paths (default 'yes')

Example usage:
%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/bropo --with-rave=/opt/rave 
--with-png=/opt/png12/include,/opt/lib
or
%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/bropo

BUILD
Just run make
%> make

TEST
bRopo comes with a set of unit tests that should probably be run to just verify 
that your build works predictably.
%> make test

INSTALL
Installation is performed with
%> make install

!!! Follow the instructions output to you by the install procedure to update 
your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH !!! 
RAVE contains an instruction on what to do with your .pth file. The same 
instruction allies to bRopo. In other words, if you don't have permission to 
write your .pth file to your Python distrution's site-packages directory, then 
follow those instructions.

Hopefully you are finished now and are able to use the software.

If you are running the RAVE toolbox XML-RPC server, you should copy the file 
pyropo/ropo_realtime.py into your RAVE installation's Lib directory.
