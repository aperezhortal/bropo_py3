Install instructions for bRack (Baltrad RACK)

INTRODUCTION
bRack is a baltrad adaption of the 'DRAIN' and 'RACK' that
is a radar data processing system.

REQUIREMENTS

Before installing bRack a number of modules/software packages have to be
installed (and their dependencies). But in short, if you have got the
following packages installed you should be good to go.
- a (Gnu) C++ compiler
- GNU make
- Python 2.6 final or 2.7.x, but not 3.x
- Rave (at least build hudson-Rave-172-SUCCESS)
- libpng12.so PNG image files

Optionally you can also build with Magick++ to get support for several image file formats
- Magick++ (Magick++-config, libMagick++.so) 

PREPARATION
Rave has it's own installation instructions so follow them in order to get the
rave package in place.

PNG12 can usually be installed as a package, in some debian based linuces it can be
installed with
%> sudo apt-get install libpng12-0

If you want to install Magick++ in for example ubuntu, you can install it with 
%> sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev

BUILDING
The building is performed with the traditional ./configure; make; make install.

The simplest way to configure bRack is to ensure that you have access to rave
through python and then let ./configure atempt to identify the rave software.
I.e. if you can do the following you might be lucky:
%> python -c "import _rave;print _rave.__file__"
/opt/baltrad/rave/Lib/_rave.so

If not, you probably need to use the configure argument for rave together with
png and magick++.

CONFIGURE ARGUMENTS
--prefix=ROOT                 This is the root directory of the brack installation. [default /opt/baltrad/brack]

--with-rave=ROOT              Points out the rave root directory (default 'yes')
  
--with-png=ROOT or INC,LIB    Points out the png root installation or include, library paths (default 'yes')

--with-magick=BIN             The Magick++-config binary (default 'no')

Example usage:
%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/brack --with-rave=yes --with-png=/opt/png12/include,/opt/lib --with-magick=yes

or

%> ./configure --prefix=/opt/brack

MAKE
Just run make

%> make

INSTALL
Installation is performed with

%> make install

Hopefully you are finished now and are able to use the software.
